     * nofollow: prevents the bot from following links from this page
     * nosnippet: prevents a snippet from being shown in the search results

     * noarchive: prevents search engine from showing the Cached link for a page.
     * unavailable_after:[date]: lets you specify the exact time and date you want to stop crawling and indexing of this page
